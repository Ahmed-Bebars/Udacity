## Description

The project is a completion of the starter code found at https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page
which represents a basic landing page layout, but this version includes the following features to be responsiveness:
* Dynamic generated navigation items based on the provided sections
* Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
* Hiding fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
	* achived by setTimeout and clearTimeout functions.
* Adding a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
